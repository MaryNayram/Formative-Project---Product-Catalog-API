- Product Catalog API is a Node.js and Express.js-based RESTful API for managing e-commerce products, categories, variants, and inventory.  
-Built with: MongoDB for data storage and **Joi** for structured validation.  
- Setup: 
  - Clone the repository and install dependencies.  
  - Configure a `.env` file with `PORT` and `MONGO_URI`.  
  - Start the server with `npm run dev`.  
- Core Features:  
  - CRUD operations for products (`/api/products`), categories (`/api/categories`), and inventory (`/api/inventory`).  
  - Product search via `/api/search`.  
  - Stock level tracking and category assignment.  
- Assumptions & Limitations:  
  - Requires a valid MongoDB connection.  
  - Input validation enforced via **Joi**.  
  - No authentication or role-based access (planned future enhancement).  
  - Lacks automated inventory updates and advanced search capabilities (possible future improvements).
